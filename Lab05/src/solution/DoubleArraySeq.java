/**
 * A DoubleArraySeq keeps track of a sequence of double numbers. The sequence
 * can have a special current element, which is specified and accessed through
 * four methods that are not available in the IntArrayBag class (start,
 * getCurrent, advance, and isCurrent.
 * 
 * Note that the addAfter and addBefore methods do not allocate more memory
 * until the current capacity of the sequence is reached.
 * 
 * Note also that any attempt to increase the capacity of any sequence beyond
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE will cause the sequence to fail with an arithmetic
 * overflow.
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * 
 * 1. The capacity of a sequence change change after it is created, but the
 * maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the machine. The
 * constructor, addAfter, addBefore, clone, and concatenation will result in an
 * OutOfMemoryError when free memory is exhausted. 2. A sequence's capacity
 * cannot exceed the largest integer 2,147,483,647 (Integer.Max_VALUE). Any
 * attempt to create a larger capacity results in failure due to an arithmetic
 * overflow.
